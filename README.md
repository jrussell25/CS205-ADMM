# CS205-ADMM
Group 17 final project for Harvard CS 205, Spring 2020.
 
### Required Software

This implementation requires on `xtensor` and the closely related library `xtensor-blas`. 
For optimal performance, one should also use `xsimd`.
The easier way to install these libraries is with Anaconda. The following command will
install these libraries and their dependencies (it is recommended to install these packages in
a fresh conda environment.

```conda install -c conda-forge xtensor xtensor-blas xsimd```

In addition to these libraries, we use CMake to compile our code and Intel's C++ compiler, 
Math Kernel Library, and MPI Implementation. This software is all available on the Harvard Cluster.
The script `gogo_modules.sh` will load them all using the LMod package manager.

Before compiling our code you need to tell cmake where the xtensor headers live. 
On the Harvard cluster, where user created conda environments live in 
`~/.conda`, one should run 

```cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.conda/envs/your_xtensor_env_name```.
